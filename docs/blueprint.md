# **App Name**: AMW Hub

## Core Features:

- Discord CTA: Prominent display of a Discord invite link, configurable via JSON.

- Events Index: Filterable list of events (upcoming, live, past) sourced from a JSON data file.
- Event Details: Detailed view of individual events, including descriptions, schedules, participants, and scoreboards (for past events).
- Media Gallery: A gallery or list of AMW-related media (videos, streams, clips), with links and thumbnails, based on data in JSON files.
- Admin Instructions: Simple README documentation on how to update the JSON data files.
- Featured Streams Section: Embed recent or high-priority streams from AMW members directly onto the homepage. Select featured videos through admin file updates.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark slate blue (#37474F) for a professional and modern feel.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) to draw attention to key interactive elements and CTAs.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font for a modern and neutral feel.
- Use simple, consistent icons from a library like FontAwesome or Material Icons, primarily in the accent color (teal).
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout that is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- Use subtle hover effects and transitions to provide visual feedback without being distracting.
